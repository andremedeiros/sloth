# Sloth

A _VERY_ experimental static analysis tool.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'sloth'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sloth

## Usage

This does very little, as in, it doesn't do what it says on the tin yet. Keep an
eye out for updates.

3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
